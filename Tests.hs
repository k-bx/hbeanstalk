-- Test hbeanstalkh library against a real beanstalkd server.
-- This script assumes the server is running on localhost:11300, and can
-- be executed with `runhaskell Tests.hs`
-- For best results, this should probably be run against a newly started
-- server with zero jobs (restart server, and run without persistence)
